## It will have ##

-Account access.

-Different levels access:

 *    master : can see the progress from each worker, general view and change task assignations.
 
 *    worker : can see its own progress and general view.
 
-Two modes:

 *    Local  mode: it uses local files to fill the boards.

 *    Remote mode: connection to a data base to fill the boards.

-A personal chart for each 'worker' and a general one.
